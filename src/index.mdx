# Dreamers LAB
My name is Zain Ul Hassan & I am a student who loves to learn new technologies. Coding is my hobby and that's why I always try to create awesome and cool stuff through my knowledge. I have developed a lot of useful extensions for App Inventor and distros. You can get all of extensions for free. Moreover I run a small YouTube channel where I teach App Development and other stuff like Extension Development. You can watch the course on YouTube.

## [Become a patreon](https://www.patreon.com/dreamerslab)

I mostly publish my work for free because I understand that mostly users are students and they can't pay. So I don't get any amount for my work. But like everyone, I also need money for living. You can become a supporter to help me keep sharing new extensions and other stuff for free. Your support will help me to fulfill my dreams.
