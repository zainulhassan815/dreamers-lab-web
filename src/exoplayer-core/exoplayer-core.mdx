### 2- How to add subtitles

> ![AddMedia](./images/add_media.png)

Add a new media item to playlist. You can use this block to add multiple media items which are then managed by the player in the form of playlist. For subtitles, you need to pass in a list of subtitles. Below is a detailed guide for adding subtitles.

To add subtitles there are two ways :

#### Dictionary Block

> ![SubtitlesUsingDictionary](./images/subtitle_dictionary_sample.png)

You can pass a list of subtitles by using dictionary blocks.
Here only two parameters are required :

- path
- mime_type

And the rest of the parameters are optional and you can skip them.

#### JSON String
