# Relative View

Relative is a simple and easy to use overlapping extension based on [Relative Layout](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/RelativeLayout) which enables you to create complex overlapped UIs easily. The UI is persistent across devices. It doesnâ€™t matter if the device is wide or long. It keeps the UI as it is in all devices.
